 ABSTRACT 
Importance: Female sex is a major risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer Disease (AD), and sex hormones have been implicated as a possible protective factor. Neuroimaging studies that evaluated the effects of sex hormones on brain integrity have primarily emphasized neurodegenerative measures, not amyloid and tau accumulation.
Objective: We compared global and regional amyloid and tau positron emission tomography (PET) deposition between cognitively normal males and females. We also compared preclinical AD pathology between females who have and have not used hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Finally, we compare the effects of amyloid and tau pathology on cognition, testing for both sex and HRT effects.
Design, Setting, and Participants:  We analyzed amyloid, tau, and cognition in a cognitively normal cohort of older individuals (n = 773) followed at the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center. Amyloid and tau PET, medication history, and neuropsychological testing were obtained for each participant.
Results: Within cognitively normal individuals, female participants had significantly higher tau PET levels than males in seven regions, including the rostral middle frontal and superior temporal regions. HRT accounted for a small reduction in tau PET; however, males still had substantially lower tau PET compared to females. Tau PET accumulation was negatively associated with cognitive performance, regardless of sex or HRT.
Conclusions and Relevance: Regional sex-related differences in tau PET accumulation may contribute to the disparities in AD prevalence between males and females. The observed protective effect of HRT on tau PET accumulation has important implications for clinical practice and trials and deserves future longitudinal studies.
